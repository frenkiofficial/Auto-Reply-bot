## üöÄ Getting Started: Setup & Usage Guide

Follow these steps to get your Auto Reply Bot up and running:

1.  **Clone or Download:**
    *   Get the code: Clone this repository or download the source code ZIP from the repository page.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/frenkiofficial/Auto-Reply-bot.git
    cd Auto-Reply-bot          # Navigate into the project directory
    ```
    *   If you downloaded a ZIP, extract it and navigate into the folder using your terminal or command prompt.

2.  **(Recommended) Create a Virtual Environment:**
    *   This keeps project dependencies isolated.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # Activate on Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # Activate on macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    *   Install the required Python library (`python-telegram-bot`).
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Get Your Telegram Bot Token:**
    *   Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`.
    *   Send `/newbot` and follow the instructions to create your bot.
    *   BotFather will give you an **API Token**. **Keep this token secure and private!**

5.  **Store Your Token:**
    *   Create a file named `token.txt` in the main project directory (`Auto-Reply-bot/`).
    *   Paste **only** your API Token into this file and save it.

6.  **Configure Keywords & Replies:**
    *   Open the `config.json` file.
    *   Edit the keywords (keys) and their replies (values).
        *   **Keywords (keys):** Should be in lowercase. The bot will match these case-insensitively within user messages.
        *   **Replies (values):** The text the bot should send back.
    *   Example `config.json`:
        ```json
        {
          "hello": "Hi there! Welcome.",
          "support": "For support, please email support@example.com.",
          "price list": "You can find our prices here: [Your Link]"
        }
        ```
    *   Save the `config.json` file (ensure it's saved with UTF-8 encoding).

7.  **Run the Bot:**
    *   Execute the main Python script from your terminal (make sure you are inside the `Auto-Reply-bot` directory):
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    *   You should see output like "Starting bot polling..." and "Bot is running...".
    *   Your bot is now active!

8.  **Test Your Bot:**
    *   Find your bot on Telegram (using the username you gave it).
    *   Send `/start`.
    *   Send messages containing the keywords you added to `config.json`.
    *   Add the bot to a group and test it there too.

**Note:** If you modify `config.json` while the bot is running, you'll need to stop the bot (Ctrl+C in the terminal) and restart it (`python main.py`) for the changes to take effect.
